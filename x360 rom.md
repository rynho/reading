THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO INSTALLING GAMES!

Hi there! You may be wondering, "How do I install ISO's on my RGH/JTAG Xbox 360?" Well this is the right post for you!

INTRODUCTION Most games you get from the internet are in the format .iso,in folders containing a file called "default.xex" or some file with random numbers and letters. The .iso's files are ripped from the console and the folder containing "default.xex" are extracted .isos and the random numbers and letters are usually Arcade games or GoD games (Games on Demand).

PREPARE THE GAME The .iso's can either be extracted by 360MPGUI or XIB, etc. They can also be converted into the GoD format using ISOTOGOD. I personally recommend the GoD since it's a gurantee they work, sometimes extracted games don't work but that's really rare. If you wanna prepare multi-disk games, it's a bit more complicated. Some games like GTA V and Halo 4 are really easy to install, basically in the disc 1 iso, theres a content folder which you can just extract and copy into your Xbox 360's hard drive directory, "HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/" (The 0's are not exact) But some games like Watch Dogs, are a bit complicated and others like Wolfenstein: The New Order which has 4 discs is alot more complicated and can only be played as a GoD game. You can of course convert Watch Dogs disc 1 and disc 2 both to GoD and same with Wolfenstein: The New Order and extracting them is a bit more complicated so I'd recommend just converting them to GoD format, then place the discs in the HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/" directory.

INSTALLING THE GAME With extracted games, you can play them using homebrew like XEX Menu FSD 3 and Aurora, just place the extracted files in a folder, for ex : GTA V, and then launch the default.xex or mp.xex or game.xex, you can place paths with Aurora and FSD3, and it'll automatically detect it and you can launch from there. The GoD file games aka the random letters and numbers, the folder should be named for example, C0DE9999. Place the folder in "HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/" directory and boom, it'll appear in the NXE aka stock dashboard or in Aurora if you put the path there, it's really convenient.

TITLE UPDATES/DLC It's pretty easy to install DLC's and Title Updates, One thing is that the don't focus on the media ID on the game when looking for updates and DLC's, focus on the Title ID. Just download the DLC and it should be random numbers and letters for example 6F6992766050D818245ADD40 8031E280FB5F4E634D , the contents inside that folder is the DLC/Title Update, if not. For title updates make a folder inside the title id folder and name it, 000B0000 then place tu aka title update file in there and put it in the title id folder, for DLC it should look something like this

HDD:Content0000000000000000<GAME TITLE ID FOLDER>00000002<DLC FILE HERE>

and for title updates it should look something like this

HDD:Content0000000000000000<GAME TITLE ID FOLDER>000B0000<TU FILE HERE>

If your DLC is not working, there are usually two main suspects, wrong title id or the dlc isn't unlocked, you can unlock the dlc using 360 Content Manager
